# Traffic-Light-Controller-Using-Arduino-In-Proteus
A simple traffic light system for a 4 way intersection is implemented using Arduino UNO. Although it is not the ideal implementation for real life scenarios, it gives an idea of the process behind the traffic light control system.  The working of the project is very simple Components:  Arduino UNO 8 Traffic Light 1 push button Others Components like wire,ground,power, resistor etc
