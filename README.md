# Traffic-Light-Controller-Using-Arduino-In-Proteus
In this project, You Will know How to Make Traffic Light Controller Using Arduino In Proteus . A simple traffic light system for a 4 way intersection is implemented using Arduino UNO.

## Separate signals have been used for pedestrian extraction. When someone clicks or pushes a button, all road traffic will be red, only pedestrians will be green. 

Although it is not the ideal implementation for real life scenarios, it gives an idea of the process behind the traffic light control system.

The working of the project is very simple

## Components:

Arduino UNO
8 Traffic Light
1 push button
Others Components like wire,ground,power, resistor etc
